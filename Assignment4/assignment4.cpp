 * Use separate compilation to implement a polynomial ADT that manipulates polynomials in a single variable x (e.g., p = 4 x5 + 7 x 3 â€“ x2 + 9 ). 
 * For this problem, consider only polynomials whose exponents are nonnegative integers. 
 * You are required to identify a proper data representation schema to store such polynomials and hide such data from external users of this ADT. 
 * Additionally, your ADT will at least include the following member functions:
 *      One default constructor, which creates a polynomial with no terms.
 *      One method allowing one to get an entire polynomial by interacting with the user (by writing to cout and reading from cin) to obtain the degree and coefficient of each term in a polynomial. 
 *          If the user enters nonsense, your program should not crash! 
 *          It is up to you how to handle this case. 
 *      The method can look something like this when called:
 *      myPolynomial.readFromUser();    // prompts the user for the degree and coefficients and stores the results in myPolynomial
 *      degree() // Returns the degree of a polynomial, which is the highest power of a term with a nonzero coefficient. E.g.: int deg = myPolynomial.degree();
 *      coefficient(power) // Returns the coefficient of the x p o w e r term.
 *      changeCoefficient(newCoefficient, power) // Replaces the coefficient of the x p o w e r term with newCoefficient.
 *      A method that multiplies a polynomial by an integer (make this a normal named method - do not overload the multiplication operator).
 *      A method that adds two polynomials (you can overload the addition operator or make this a normal named method).
 *      method that prints out a polynomial.
 *      Overload the negation operator (-) as a member function to negate a polynomial.
 *      (NOTE: This is different from the subtraction operator! 
 *      The subtraction operator takes an argument - the polynomial you are subtracting - whereas the negation operator takes no arguments.)
 *
